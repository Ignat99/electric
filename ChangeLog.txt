FIX: In Clipboard.copyListToCell() copy the geometric list before modifying it.

BUG: (10/22/09, GVG) Crash when changing cell parameters (Bug #2442)
FIX: Temporary patch to avoid the exception. Not the solution yet.

************************* Version 8.10k: ******************************

BUG: (10/18/09, AM) BTree waveform code randomly transposes signals.
FIX: Heed the distinction between a signal's "index" and its "number".

BUG: (10/18/09, DN) NPE while moving objects in threadsafe mode (Bug #2431).
     Cell.getBounds() algorithm had a bug which appeared in threadsafe mode with
     its lazy RTree calculation. Previously RTree calculated always and these
     calculation hid this bug.
FIX: In Cell.getBounds() recalculate bounds of subcells in BOUNDS_CORRECT_GEOM
     and BOUNDS_RECOMPUTE cases.

BUG: (10/16/09, GVG) TechEditorWizard  doesn't write metal pin when numMetals=1
     (Bug #2433)
FIX: Pins not longer defined in same loop as the metal contacts. Extra code to
     detect arcs without pins associated (in an invalid tech for example).

BUG: (10/16/09, GVG) NPE if no pin associated to the arc is found (Bug #2432)
FIX: Case detected (probably due to invalid tech) and routing path is discarded

     #2423)

BUG: (10/16/09, DN) NPE while moving objects (Bug #2431).
FIX: Measures to prevent Electric from hang:
     1) Assertion Errors don't stop GUI thread;
     2) MessagesStream prints elsewhere when Job.getUserIntereface() == null;
     3) UserInterfaceMain.showSnapshot recovers database if undo fails;
     4) Cell.recover() assign cellBounds to computed bounds instead of assert;

BUG: (10/16/09, DN) NPE in CVS with threadsafe mode on (Bug #2429).
FIX: In Edit.MarkForEditJob.doIt call
     fieldVariableChanged("uneditMatchedStrings") earlier.

IMP: (10/13/09, GVG) Threadsafe (FULL_SCREEN_SAFE) mode back to default.
     Use -nothreadsafe to switch to previous mode.

IMP: (10/12/09, GVG) Export names not sorted multi-object properties dialog (Bug
     #2419).  Adding sorting of highlights before they added into the selection
     list.

BUG: (10/12/09, GVG) build.xml broken: not producing the right thing for GNU
     releases (Bug #2427)
FIX: In generalPurposeJar, rolling back to unjarSun and zipfilesets commented out

BUG: (10/12/09, GVG) NPE in Spice if no schematic associated to an icon is found
     (Bug #2428)
FIX: Detecting the case and assigning icon name as unique name.

BUG: (10/10/09, AM) Waveform viewer sometimes truncates data
     horizontally when using BTrees (Bug #2413)
FIX: Do not snap the least and greatest visible times (t0 and t1) to
     events before partitioning the space between them into equal
     sized chunks.

IMP: (10/10/09, AM) NewSignal: request approximations by supplying a
     desired number of events rather than an integer time denominator
     -- the latter did not offer any way of asking for events which
     are more than one time unit apart.

IMP: (10/10/09, AM) Implement BTree.{getOrdFromKey,getOrdFromKeyFloor}.

BUG: (10/10/09, AM) changes to grid do not take effect until next repaint (Bug
     #2409)
FIX: Invoke EditWindow.repaintAllContents() from GridAndAlignmentTab.

BUG: (10/10/09, AM) Re-deprecate Infrastructure.waitSeconds() (Bug #2386)
FIX: Use Thread.sleep() instead.

BUG: (10/10/09, AM) Make of ColorPrefType.HIGHLIGH* values in pulsing highlight

IMP: (10/7/09, GVG) Back to DEFAULT_MODE = Mode.FULL_SCREEN_UNSAFE until
     "threadsafe mode slow?" (bug #2420) is further investigated.

IMP: (10/7/09, DN) cvspm.Edit.UneditResponder stores matched Strings in a list
     for later processing in Edit.MarkForEditJob.terminateOK (Bug #2417).

FIX: Change Output.OutputCellInfo from CLIENT_EXAMINE to SERVER_EXAMINE .
     In Make.UserInterfacDummy.terminateJob check for Job.isThreadSeafe().

IMP: (10/5/09, GVG) Toggle Grid and resolution warnings (Bug# 2404)

BUG: (10/1/09, GVG) Marina scripts fail with "Conflicting thread modes:
     BATCH and THREAD_SAFE" (Bug #2411)

IMP: (9/30/09, AM) Rename com.sun.electric.tool.btree to
     com.sun.electric.database.geometry.btree as instructed by SMR.

BUG: (9/29/09, SMR) Bold grid dot spacing cannot be changed (Bug #2405).
FIX: Made bold spacing use integers, not doubles.

BUG: (9/29/09, SMR) Implant coverage generator leaves notches (Bug #2408).
FIX: Better testing for areas within DRC limits.

FIX: Rounded the "meter unit" read from the GDS file.

IMP: (9/29/09, GVG) Made "-threadsafe" (Mode.THREAD_SAFE) by default to test new
     mode and fixes for bug #2293

IMP: (9/29/09, DN) A simple scheduler for CLIENT_EXAMINE jobs in thread-safe
     mode.

IMP: (9/28/09, GVG) Extra code to detect case described in Bug #2151

BUG: (9/28/09, GVG) NPE in Export PS (Bug #2407)
FIX: Detect the 3D case and aborts the action. PS is only available from an
     EditWindow instance

IMP: (9/28/09, AM) Successfully loaded a 1.1GB simulation file using a
     400MB JVM heap (-Xmx=400m).  Loading time was 3.8 minutes, and
     once loaded panning/scrolling showed no perceptible delay.

IMP: (9/28/09, AM) Stream simulation data directly from the disk into
     the BTree rather than storing it in an intermediate byte[].  We
     can now officially load simulation files that are "bigger than
     memory".

IMP: (9/28/09, AM) Finish implementing BTree.getValFromOrd(), which
     lets us switch from a BTree<Integer,Pair<Double,Double>> to a
     BTree<Double,Double>.  Not much impact on time to load a file,
     but cuts memory use by ~33%.  Making the rasterization code use
     getValFromOrd() instead of doing a binary search made a huge
     difference in UI responsiveness, though.

BUG: (9/25/09, GVG) Can't save file in MacOSX after browsing in the save dialog
     box (Bug #2326)
FIX: Using URL instead of String to open the FileWriter

************************* Version 8.10i: ******************************

     cells to be selected and viewed (Bug #2322).
FIX: Now handle all selected cells.

IMP: (9/24/09, SMR) New Display Preference: "Show cell results in new window"
     causes commands that show a cell to do it in a new window.  The commands
     are: "Edit XXX View", "Make XXX View", do Placement, ROM generation, PLA
     generation, etc. (Bug #2388).

BUG: (09/24/09, GVG) Non-deterministic results in AutoFillTemplate test (Bug

     it adds in the node the export is on so it can be copied (if copyExports is
     on)

IMP: (09/22/09, JKG) Node extractor: improved active type selection, improved
     multi-cut contact extraction to prevent lots of single contacts.

IMP: (09/22/09, AM) build.xml: produce jdk1.5-compatible bytecodes.

FIX: Sorting arcs based on length while selecting the best port to connect to.

IMP: (09/21/09, DN) Regression driver doesn't allocate mutable database.

IMP: (09/19/09, DN) If DRC.THREAD_SAFE_DRC=true, then DRC Jobs are SERVER_EXAMINE
     and can run in thread-safe mode.

IMP: (09/17/09, DN) Quick.doCheck() and Schematic.doCheck don't call termLogging.
     Instead caller terms Logging or do anything else.

BUG: (09/17/09, DN) Assertion in JobTree.updateJobs().
FIX: In UserInterfaceMain.java use SwingUtilities.invokeLater for updating Jobs.

************************* Version 8.10h: *******************************

FIX: Improved Edit commands so that cut/copy/paste/erase/select all work
     properly.

BUG: (9/16/09, SMR) Zero-size arcs are not area-selectable (Bug #2394).
FIX: In PolyBase.polyDistance() use DBMath.rectsIntersect() instead of
     Rectangle.intersects() because the later doesn't handle zero-size rects.

IMP: (9/16/09, DN) Command-line switch "-threadsafe" turns on thread-safe mode.

BUG: (9/16/09, GVG) IRSIM on layouts and exceptions (Bug #2397)

BUG: (9/14/09, AM) Merge com.sun.async.test.* into Electric code base
     (Bug #2347).  As discussed with SMR (in person), JKG (in person),
     GVG (on phone), and DN (on phone).
FIX: After appropriate massaging, check former contents of
     /proj/async/cad/cvs/test/ into electric/srcj/com/sun/async/test/.
     Please see the package.html for details.  I have also
     write-protected the old CVS repository so people don't accidentally
     check in anything new (any changes should go in here now).

     data: 74%.  Combined with two previous modifications: 96%
     improvement (time required is 4% of time previously required).

IMP: (9/9/09, AM) Change PageStorage to a zero-copy API, at the
     expense of doing more byte[] allocation.  This made it feasible
     to increase the default page size from 1024 bytes to just under
     4096 bytes (because the System.arraycopy()'s are no longer
     killing us).  Net result: 73% improvement in time to build BTree.
     Combined with previous modification: 84% improvement (time
     required is 26% of time previously required).

IMP: (8/31/09, SMR) User's Manual search highlights search keys.

IMP: (8/30/09, AM) Right-align signal names in the waveform viewer,
     and truncate from the left when necessary.  When a signal name is
     very long due to being deep in the hierarchy, the *rightmost*
     part of the signal name is most useful to the user.

IMP: (8/30/09, AM) Add a menu item to Window->WaveformWindow for each
     icon button in the waveform window.  Aside from acting as
     documentation, this makes it possible for users to add a
     keystroke for those buttons.

IMP: (8/30/09, AM) Add Edit->Move->Recenter Cell on Selection.

BUG: (8/28/09, JKG) Stitch fill generator not keeping arc extension (Bug #2364)

IMP: (8/18/09, SMR) Added Placement tool.

BUG: (8/18/09, SMR) Moving diagonal arcs may break them (Bug #2341).
FIX: Special diagonal arc handling only used if Manhattan arcs connected
     to them are NOT selected.

BUG: (8/17/09, AM) Pulsating error highlighting causes 100% CPU usage
     (Bug #2348)
FIX: Use a javax.swing.Timer instead of repaint requests.

BUG: (8/17/09, GVG) Fill generator is not putting enough contacts in when
     connecting to cell instance (Bug #2340)
FIX: Adding nodes in SearchInHierarchy.

BUG: (8/17/09, SMR) If two arcs are in a line, meeting at an end (not sharing
     a pin, but each having their own pin, and the pins are coincident)
     then it is not possible to select the two arcs and use right-click
     to wire them.  Instead, all points are wired to (0,0) (Bug #2339).
FIX: In "InteractiveRouter.getIntersection()" the parallel but intersecting
     case is now handled.

IMP: (8/16/09, AM) Finished first round of performance tuning for
     BTree-based storage of simulation data.

BUG: (8/16/09, AM) Adjust CalibreDrcErrors so that a "CN" line applies
     to all the rest of the errors for that rule, rather than just the
     next error.  Jon Gainsley: please verify this! (Bug #2338).

IMP: (8/16/09, AM) Add pulsating error highlighting.  This is
     useful because using motion to direct the user's attention (rather
     than color) works with any color scheme.

IMP: (8/15/09, AM) Add "duplicate in place" option.  When this is
     enabled, the "duplicate" command will place the duplicated object
     exactly where the original was.  This is far more useful than the
     default behavior when you have layout geometry that needs to stay
     on a grid.

IMP: (8/12/09, AM) use BTree in ScalarEpicAnalysis.  It works.  But it
     is slow.

IMP: (8/11/09, AM) add JDBM-based implementation of BTree (temporary,
     just to get something working quickly).

IMP: (8/11/09, AM) build.xml: add support for temporary use of jdbm
     libraries (SUN builds only).

IMP: (8/11/09, AM) Add BTree.java wrapper for various B-Tree
     implementations (JDBM initially, something GNU-friendly later).

     for connectivity" to control node extraction (Bug #2183).

IMP: (8/10/09, AM) Add ScalarEpicAnalysis and ScalarEpicOutProcess as
     a testing ground for new on-disk random-access simulation data
     format.

IMP: (8/10/09, AM) First chunk of tool.simulation refactoring.

BUG: (8/10/09, AM) Threading confusion has returned (Bug #2331).
FIX: Remember to check Main.isBatch().

BUG: (8/10/09, SMR) The GEM arcs do not draw properly (Bug #2300).
FIX: Finish translating the original C code for this.

BUG: (8/10/09, SMR) Explorer tree truncates library name (Bug #2327).
FIX: In ExplorerTree.MyRenderer.getTreeCellRendererComponent(), force the text
     to be the library name.

************************* Version 8.10d: ******************************

BUG: (8/6/09, SMR) "Array" doesn't remember last centerline distance used (Bug
     #2325).
FIX: Now remember for the current session.

BUG: (8/6/09, GVG) Verilog netlister isn't writing anything and complains about
     preferences. (Bug #2324)
FIX: Caching VerilogInputPreferences together with VerilogOutputPreferences.

BUG: (8/6/09, SMR) "Search" context item in LIBRARIES explorer node fails (Bug
     #2322).
FIX: Rewrite ExplorerTree.searchAction() to show all results.

BUG: (8/6/09, GVG) false DRC error between pdiff contacts in tsmcsun40GP (Bug
     #2311)
FIX: Better detection if active from contacts overlaps with transistor active

BUG: (8/6/09, DN) Exception in PixelDrawing.drawText, text rotated 270 degrees
     (Bug #2291).
FIX: In PixelDrawing.drawText clean assignments to sx and ex.

IMP: (8/5/09, GVG) Better short names in palette icons for well and active
     contacts (Bug #2323)

BUG: (8/5/09, JKG) Fixes for node extraction. PURELAYERNODEMODE in node
     extractor, probably should be preference. Changes to auto-stitcher used by
     node extractor. (Bugs #2183, #2239)
     (1) changed conditions for forcing an arc to have no head/tail extends
        (RouteElementArc.java)
     (2) more code for aligning to grid, for node extraction
        (InteractiveRouter.java)
     (3) fixes for node extractor, mostly in re-exporting up the hierarchy
         (AutoStitch.java)
     (4) purelayernodemode that extracts mostly pure layer nodes. lots of fixes
         (Connectivity.java)

IMP: (8/5/09, JKG) fix for null color in LayerDrawing.java

     Feature added but not turn on for 40nm yet.

BUG: (8/4/09, GVG) Pplus/Nplus enclosure of Well/  Subs taps should be 2
     instead of 8 (Bug #2320)
FIX: Added STRAP values to the TechEditorWizard

BUG: (8/4/09, GVG) Allowable connections to P-Well-con should be Pwell arc,
     not Pdiff arc (same for N-Well-con) (Bug #2319)
FIX: Ports fixed for those well contacts defined in a generic way.

IMP: (8/4/09, SMR) When placing a node from the component menu, typing "," or
     "." before clicking rotates the node's initial orientation (Bug #2253).

BUG: (8/4/09, SMR) "Change" dialog takes too long when changing arcs with nodes

IMP: (1/13/09, RK) I removed the backwards compatibility hack in NCC that
     infers NodeProto.Function from the name of the PrimitiveNode.
     This removed the references to TRANMOS and TRAPMOS in NCC. However
     to do this, I needed to update the Technologies: MoCMOS and CMOS90
     so they correctly use the new NodeProto.Functions. (Bug #1858)

     Technology.getTransistorBiasPort(NodeInst ni) so that MoCMOS
     transistors also return the body contact. I changed the MoCMOS
     constructor to allow well arcs to attach to well contacts. I added
     an option to NCC to enable the checking of body contacts. I changed
     NCC so it optionally checks body contacts. I added body checking
     tests to NCC regression. I added body checking documentation to
     the NCC user's manual. (Bug #1910)

    CheckAndRepairJob ensures consistency between parameters on icon and schematic cells.
    Icon/schematic cells in a group shares parameter names, default values, and units.
    They may differ in text descriptor (except units, param flag, inherit flag).
    CheckAndRepairJob constructs absent parameters on icon cell from name/value/unit on
    main schematics and from text text descriptor on example instance of icon cell.
    Attribute dialog also tries to maintain consistency between parameters on icons/schematics
    in a cell group, though it is not database invariant yet.

    Parameters are not allowed on cells other than icons/schematics.
    Parameters on icon instances inherits patched text descriptor from
    icon cell. Patching means: cleared params and inherit and interior flag.
    Display flag of instance parameter is the negateion of the interior flag of
    icon Cell parameter.

    Spice netlister automatically detects paramters necessary for Spice output.
    It writes them and only them as subcircuit parameters into Spice decks.
    Both Spice and Java syntax are allowed for such parameters.
