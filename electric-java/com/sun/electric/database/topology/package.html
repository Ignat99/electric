Package for connected Nodes and Arcs.
Each facet consists of a network of nodes and arcs.
Nodes are electrical components such as transistors and contacts.
Arcs are wires that connect nodes.
Each node has ports on it which are the sites of arc connections.
A port may connect to any number of arcs, but every arc connects exactly two ports.

Actual implementation of the database uses two types of objects for the nodes, arcs, and ports.
A single prototype object describes the typical node, arc, or port;
and multiple instance objects are created for every actual node, arc, and port used in a circuit.
Thus, the transistor is represented as a node prototype and four port prototypes in the technology.
Every use of a transistor in a circuit is then represented as a node instance with port instances for the connections.
