<H4>The Support Cell</H4>
<P>
Each cell in a technology library describes a different aspect of the technology.
The <I>support</I> cell contains technology-wide information.
To see this, edit the cell "factors" under the "TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT" section
of the cell explorer.

<P>
The support cell contains many items, any of which can be changed by double-clicking on it.
<UL>
<LI>"Scale" is the scaling factor between grid units and nanometers.</LI>
<LI>"Description" is the full description of the technology.</LI>
<LI>"Minimum Resistance" is the minimum resistance for the technology
(see <A HREF="chap09-10-01.html#chap09-10-01">Section 9-10-1</A> for this and other parasitics).</LI>
<LI>"Minimum Capacitance" is the minimum capacitance for the technology.</LI>
<LI>"Gate Shrinkage" is the gate shrinkage for the technology.</LI>
<LI>"Gates Included in Resistance" tells whether to include a transistor's gate in resistance computations.</LI>
<LI>"Parasitics Includes Ground" tells whether to include ground networks in parasitics computations.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Transparent Colors</H4>
<P>
Double-clicking on the "Transparent Colors" entry shows a dialog for selecting the transparent colors.
You must define as many colors as you have used in the layers.

<P>
<H4>Design Rules</H4>
<P>
Unfortunately, it is not possible to edit design rules associated with the technology.
However, you can add design rules to the XML files produced by the technology editor.
To do this, examine the XML files for some existing technologies (for example, CMOS)
and copy these lines to the new XML file, editing where appropriate for layer names and spacings.

<H4>The Component Menu</H4>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig08-08.png" ALT="Figure 8.8"></CENTER></TD><TD>
To customize the layout of the component menu, use the <B>Edit Component Menu...</B> command
(in menu <B>Edit / Technology Editing</B>).
This dialog works exactly the same as the Component Menu Preferences
(see <A HREF="chap04-05-01.html#chap04-05-01">Section 4-5-1</A>).
