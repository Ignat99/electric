<!-- HEADER 3-6-3: Export Deletion and Movement -->

<!-- COMMAND Export/Delete Export -->
<!-- COMMAND Export/Delete Exports on Selected -->
<!-- COMMAND Export/Delete Exports in Highlighted Area -->
<!-- COMMAND Export/Move Export -->
<!-- COMMAND Export/Manipulate Exports... -->

You can delete an export simply by selecting its name and using the <B>Selected</B>
command of the <B>Edit / Erase</B> menu (or typing the Delete key).
You can also use the <B>Delete Export</B> command (in menu <B>Export</B>).
<P>
To remove many exports at once,
the <B>Delete Exports on Selected</B> command removes all exports on all highlighted nodes.
Also, the <B>Delete Exports in Highlighted Area</B>
command removes only those exports that are in the selected area.
When an export is deleted, all arcs connected to that port on instances of the current cell
(higher up the hierarchy) are also deleted
(see <A HREF="chap02-03.html#chap02-03">Section 2-3</A>).
<P>
To move export text, simply select it and drag it.
The location of the text has no effect on the location of the export:
moving the text is only for improvement of the display.
However, if you check "Move node with export name" in the
Ports/Exports Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "Ports/Exports" tab),
then moving an export name will cause the node (and the export) to move as well.
<P>
It is sometimes desirable to keep an export but to transfer it to another node.
If a cell is in use higher in the hierarchy,
unexporting and then reexporting deletes all existing connections.
Instead, the <B>Move Export</B> command (in menu <B>Export</B>) can be used.
Before using this command,
two nodes and their ports must be highlighted with
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">left</A></I>
button and
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">shift-left</A></I> button.
The export is moved from the first node to the second node.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig03-35.png" ALT="Figure 3.35"></CENTER></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
You can control all existing exports in the current cell with the
<B>Manipulate Exports...</B> command.
This dialog shows the exports and lets you sort them by name, layer, or characteristic.
Schematic cells also offer a "body only" control which,
when checked, makes that export appear only in the body (the schematic) and not in the icon cell
(see <A HREF="chap03-06-01.html#chap03-06-01">Section 3-6-1</A>).
You can change export names and characteristics.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
If multiple exports are selected, changing one of their characteristics changes all of them.
You can also delete, show, or renumber selected exports.
Renumbering of exports presumes that the exports have numbers in their names
and renames them so that there are no gaps in the sequence (and the first has no number).
For example, the ports "gnd_7", "gnd_9", and "gnd_10" will be renamed "gnd", "gnd_1", and "gnd_2".
