<!-- HEADER 10-2-3: Technologies -->

All technologies used in the library must be in the header.
The other reason for a technology declaration to exist is if the technology has preferences stored on it.
If there are multiple technology lines, they are sorted by technology name.
The syntax is:
<P>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="90%">
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><B>T&lt;name&gt; [ | &lt;variable&gt; ]*</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="20%">&lt;name&gt;</TD><TD WIDTH="80%">the name of the technology.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;variable&gt;</TD><TD>a list of preferences on the technology
(stored as variables, see <A HREF="chap10-04-01.html#chap10-04-01">Section 10-4-1</A>).</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
Examples:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE><FONT SIZE="-1">Tmocmos</FONT></CODE>
<BR>
Declares that there should be a technology called "mocmos".
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE><FONT SIZE="-1">Tmocmos|ScaleFORmocmos()D200</FONT></CODE>
<BR>
Declares the technology "mocmos" and also creates a project setting on that technology object called
"ScaleFORmocmos" which is a double-precision value equal to 200.
