When editing one view of a cell,
there are commands in the <B>View</B> menu that will switch to an alternate view of the same cell.
<UL>
<LI>Use <B>Edit Layout View</B> to switch to the layout view.</LI>
<LI>Use <B>Edit Schematic View</B> to switch to the schematic view.</LI>
<LI>Use <B>Edit Icon View</B> to switch to the Icon view.</LI>
<LI>Use <B>Edit VHDL View</B> to switch to the VHDL view.</LI>
<LI>Use <B>Edit Documentation View</B> to switch to the text-only documentation view.</LI>
<LI>Use <B>Edit Skeleton View</B> to switch to the Skeleton view.</LI>
</UL>
For all other view types, use <B>Edit Other View...</B> and select the desired view.
Note that these commands are equivalent to the <B>Edit Cell...</B> command (in menu <B>Cell</B>) with an appropriate selection.
<P>
When editing cells with text-only views (VHDL, Documentation, etc.), the window becomes a text editor.
You may then use the <B>Text Cell Contents...</B> commands (in menu <B>File / Export</B> and <B>File / Import</B>)
to save and restore this text to disk.
See <A HREF="chap04-09.html#chap04-09">Section 4-9</A> for more on text editing.
<P>
The commands to edit another view work only when that cell exists.
To create a new cell of a particular type, use the <B>Make...</B> commands of the <B>View</B> menu.
These view conversion commands are available:
<UL>
<LI><B>Make Icon View</B> creates an icon from a schematic
(see <A HREF="chap03-11-04.html#chap03-11-04">Section 3-11-4</A> for more on this).</LI>

<LI><B>Make Schematic View</B> creates a schematic from a layout.</LI>

<LI><B>Make Alternate Layout View...</B> converts from layout or schematic to an alternate layout.
You must choose a specific layout technology, and the new layout will use components from that technology.
You can also request that the converted layout be placed into a new library.
This is useful if the conversion creates a hierarchy of cells in the new technology.</LI>

<LI><B>Make Skeleton View</B> makes a skeletonized layout from a layout
(the only thing in the skeleton is the exports and the frame; it is a "layout icon").</LI>

<LI><B>Make VHDL View</B> converts the current layout or schematic into structural VHDL.
This VHDL is used by the Silicon Compiler (see <A HREF="chap09-12.html#chap09-12">Section 9-12</A>)
and the ALS simulator (see <A HREF="chap09-05-02.html#chap09-05-02">Section 9-5-2</A>).
Note that there are 5 schematic primitives which can exist in a normal and negated form ("buffer", "and",
"or", "xor", and "mux").
You can choose the names to use for these two forms in the "Schematics" section of the Technology Preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Technology" section, "Technology" tab).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
There is also a way to convert from a hardware description language (VHDL or Verilog) to a circuit.
To do this, use the <B>Convert Current Cell to Rats-Nest Structure</B> command
(in menu <B>Tools / Silicon Compiler</B>).
The resulting cell will be either a layout cell or a schematics cell
(depending on the "Make Layout Cells (not Schematics)" setting in the "Verilog" preferences, see
<A HREF="chap09-04-02.html#chap09-04-02">Section 9-4-2</A>).
See
<A HREF="chap09-12.html#chap09-12">Section 9-12</A> for more on Silicon Compilation.
