<!-- PREFERENCE Tools/Placement -->

Electric has a number of placement tools that can rearrange a circuit so that routing is easier.
The tools can handle schematic or layout cells.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">
To run placement, use the <B>Floorplan and Place Current Cell</B> command
(in menu <B>Tools / Placement</B>).
This selects an appropriate placement algorithm to run.
<P>
For more precise control over placement, you can select a particular algorithm in
the Placement Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Placement" tab)
and then use the <b>Place Current Cell with Preferred Algorithm</b> command.
The Placement Preferences not only lets you select the algorithm,
but also lets you set parameters for controlling its operation.
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-26.png" ALT="Figure 9.26"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The bottom of the Placement Preferences dialog has controls for all placement operations.
These controls set a padding percentage around each placed cell (the default is 0: make the cells touch).
You can also ask the placement system to run the Sea of Gates router after placement is done
(see <A HREF="chap09-06-06.html#chap09-06-06">Section 9-6-6</A>).
