<!-- HEADER 6-7: Undo Control -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Repeat Last Action -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Undo -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Redo -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Show Undo List -->

Electric has an undo mechanism that tracks all changes made during a session.
When a command is issued, it and its side effects are stored.
<P>
The <B>Undo</B> command (in menu <B>Edit</B>) reverses the last change made
(this includes any changes that may have been made by other tools).
Multiple uses of the <B>Undo</B> command continue to undo further back.
The <B>Redo</B> command redoes changes, up to the most recent change made.

You can also use the undo (counterclockwise) and redo (clockwise) icons from the tool bar.

<P>
Electric stores only the last 40 changes, so anything older than that cannot be undone.
To increase the number of changes that are saved, use the
General Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section, "General" tab),
and change the "Maximum undo history" field.
To see a history of changes that were made, use the
<B>Show Undo List</B> command (in menu <B>Edit</B>).
<P>
In Electric, almost every command is undoable, but there are some exceptions.
Commands that write disk files are not undoable,
because Electric would not be so presumptuous as to delete a disk file.
Also, commands that read a disk file are undoable, but because users generally do not want to
remove libraries from memory once read in,
the system prompts you to be sure that such a large undo is really desired.
<P>
Another useful command in for controlling changes being made is
<B>Repeat Last Action</B> (in menu <B>Edit</B>).
This repeats the last command, but only works for commands that can sensibly be repeated.
