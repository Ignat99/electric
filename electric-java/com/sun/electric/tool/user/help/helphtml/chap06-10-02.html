<!-- HEADER 6-10-2: Manipulating Outlines -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Modes/Edit/Toggle Outline Edit -->

<TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH="30%"><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig06-05.png" ALT="Figure 6.5"></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH="70%">
To manipulate outline information on the currently highlighted node,
use "Outline Edit" mode (click on the icon in the tool bar or use
the <B>Toggle Outline Edit</B> command, in menu <B>Edit / Modes / Edit</B>).
</TD></TR></TABLE>

In this mode, there is always a "current point", identified with an "X" over it.
To further identify this point, the lines coming into and out of the point have
arrows on them indicating the direction of the outline.
<P>
In outline edit mode, the <I>left</I>
button is used to select and move a point on the outline, and the
<I>right</I>
button adds a new point after the selected one.
<P>
Besides selecting points with the mouse, you can also step through
the points of the outline with the "." key (next outline point) and "," key
(previous outline point).
These keys are under the "&gt;" and "&lt" keys, so you can think of them as the
"next point" (&gt;) and "previous point" (&lt;) commands.
<P>
The <B>Selected</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Erase</B>) deletes the current outline point
(this is the Delete key).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
When the <B>Object Properties...</B> command is issued in outline-edit mode,
a special dialog appears to show the point coordinates of the outline.
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig06-29.png" ALT="Figure 6.29"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
When done editing the outline, switch to standard selection mode
(the <B>Click/Zoom/Wire</B> command, in menu <B>Edit / Modes / Edit</B>).
