<!-- HEADER 5-4-4: Naming -->

Another property of an arc is its name.
This is a character string that is displayed on the arc and used to name the electrical network connected to that arc.
The "Name" field in the <B>Object Properties...</B> dialog allows you to specify this property,
which is then displayed on the arc.
See <A HREF="chap06-08-04.html#chap06-08-04">Section 6-8-4</A> for "smart" arc name control.
<P>
All arcs are named in Electric, so if you don't give it a name, one will be assigned.
These names, which typically take the form "object@number" are <I>temporary</I> names,
and are distinguished from the names given by the user.
Temporary names are not displayed on the arcs, but user-defined names are.
<P>
Note that creating exports is another way of naming a network.
See <A HREF="chap06-09-02.html#chap06-09-02">Section 6-9-2</A> for more on network naming.
<P>
Arc names can be quite complex when applied to busses.
The names can be indexed, aggregated, and otherwise be used to describe multiple signals.
See <A HREF="chap06-09-03.html#chap06-09-03">Section 6-9-3</A> for more on bus naming.
