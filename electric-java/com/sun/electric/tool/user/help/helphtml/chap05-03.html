<!-- HEADER 5-3: Setting Constraints -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Arc/Rigid -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Arc/Not Rigid -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Arc/Fixed Angle -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Arc/Not Fixed Angle -->

The two most common constraints, rigid and fixed-angle
(see <A HREF="chap05-02-01.html#chap05-02-01">Section 5-2-1</A>),
can be controlled from the <B>Edit / Arc</B> menu.
When the <B>Rigid</B>, <B>Non Rigid</B>,
<B>Fixed Angle</B>, and <B>Not Fixed Angle</B> commands are issued,
all of the currently highlighted arcs have those constraints set.
<P>
In order to set slidability (see <A HREF="chap05-02-02.html#chap05-02-02">Section 5-2-2</A>),
select a single arc and issue the <B>Object Properties...</B> command
(in menu <B>Edit / Properties</B>).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
At the bottom of the arc properties dialog, when the "More" button has been pressed,
are check boxes that control constraints.
This is the only way to affect the slidable constraint
 (which is not very commonly used).
