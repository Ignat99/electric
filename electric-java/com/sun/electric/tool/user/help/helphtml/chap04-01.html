This can be manipulated by dragging icons within the dialog.
To add a new toolbar button, drag a command from the list at the bottom to the toolbar image at the top.
To insert a separator, drag the "Sep" to the toolbar image.
To remove a toolbar button or separator, drag it from the toolbar image at the top to the trash icon.

Most commands in Electric do not have icons associated with them.
You can drag these commands to the toolbar, but they will all show a "?".
To add an icon to a command, select the command from the list at the bottom,
click the "Attach Image to Command..." button and choose an image file.
The image to be attached to a command must be 16 pixels high and will be scaled down if it is larger.
