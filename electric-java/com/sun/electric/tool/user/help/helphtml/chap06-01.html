Once you have created a collection of objects,
it may be desirable to have other identical copies.
There are two ways to do this: by duplication, and by cut-and-paste.
<P>
<H4>Duplication</H4>
<P>
The <B>Duplicate</B> command (in menu <B>Edit</B>) makes a copy of the selected nodes and arcs.
After issuing this command, you can move the cursor to any location and click to place the copy.
While moving the cursor, an outline of the duplicated objects is shown (as well as the amount of motion).
<P>
If you have disabled "Move after Duplicate"
(in the Nodes Preferences, in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section, "Nodes" tab)
then the duplicated objects are placed immediately without dragging.
Initially, they are moved by a predefined amount.
However, Electric remembers motion that is made after a duplication and uses that offset in subsequent duplications.
<P>
If any of the nodes have exports on them, they are not duplicated
(unless "Duplicate/Array/Paste copies exports" is set in the Nodes Preferences).
<P>
The <B>Duplicate</B> command forces newly created nodes and arcs to have unique names.
This means that if any nodes or arcs are named
(using the <B>Object Properties...</B> command, in menu <B>Edit / Properties</B>) and then duplicated,
the new ones will have different names
(specifically, the old names with numbers appended or modified).
<P>
<H4>Cut-and-Paste</H4>
<P>
Another way to make copies of nodes and arcs is with the cut-and-paste commands.
The <B>Copy</B> and <B>Cut</B> commands (in menu <B>Edit</B>) copy the currently selected nodes and arcs to a special buffer.
<B>Cut</B> also removes the objects after copying them.
The <B>Paste</B> command then copies the objects from the special buffer to the display.
After issuing this command, an outline of the pasted objects attaches to the cursor.
When you click,	the objects are placed at that location.
You can right-click during the paste drag to affect the location, and to abort the paste.
<P>
Note that if you copy a node or arc and then select another before pasting,
then the copied object will replace the selected object
(changing its type and other properties,
similar to the <B>Change...</B> command, see <A HREF="chap06-06.html#chap06-06">Section 6-6</A>).
If you want the <B>Paste</B> command to make a second copy,
be sure that nothing is selected when you issue the command.
Thus, duplicating an object cannot be done by issuing a <B>Copy</B> and then a <B>Paste</B>.
You must do a <B>Copy</B>, then deselect the object, then do a <B>Paste</B>.
