Arcs in the Schematic technology may be <I>negated</I>,
which causes them to have a bubble drawn where they attach to schematic elements.
This property can be changed with the <B>Toggle Port Negation</B> command
(in menu <B>Edit / Technology Specific</B>).
It may also be controlled by the <B>Object Properties...</B> dialog
(in menu <B>Edit / Properties</B>).
Note that you can toggle negation when an arc is selected
(which leaves the system to guess which end you want to negate)
or you can toggle negation when a node and port is selected
(in which case, the arc attached to that port is negated).
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Note that the <B>Object Properties...</B> dialog offers precise control of the negating bubbles,
allowing you to specify which ends have the bubbles on them.
Negated arcs make no sense in layout technologies and are ignored.
