<!-- HEADER 1-12-1: Introduction to Schematic/Layout Tutorial -->

This tutorial was originally written by David Harris at Harvey Mudd College
as the first in a set of lab instructions for an undergraduate-level CMOS VLSI design class.
It provides very basic instructions to acclimatize first-time users with Electric.
As such, it is not a full introduction to using Electric, nor does it cover many commonly used commands.
<P>
What this tutorial does cover is:
<UL>
<LI>Basic schematic editing.
You will create a simple "nand" gate.</LI>
<LI>Layout drawing.
You will create the IC layout of the "nand" gate.</LI>
<LI>Hierarchy.
You will assemble the "nand" with an "inverter" to build an "and" gate.</LI>
<LI>Analysis.
You will run the design rule checker on the layout, and will compare the layout with the schematic.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
To begin, load the "mipscells" library
from the Static Free Software website (<A HREF="http://www.staticfreesoft.com/productsLibraries.html">www.staticfreesoft.com/productsLibraries.html</A>).
This library contains many parts of the MIPS processor that are provided to you.
You will add your new design to the library as you work through the tutorial.
