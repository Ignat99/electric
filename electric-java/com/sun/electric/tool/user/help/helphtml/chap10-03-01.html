<!-- HEADER 10-3-1: Cells -->

After the header information, each cell is described.
A cell consists of a cell declaration ("C") followed by a number of node ("N"), instance ("I"),
arc ("A"), and export ("E") lines.
The cell is terminated with a cell-end line ("X").
Inside of a cell, all nodes come first and are sorted by the node name; arcs come next and are sorted by the arc name;
finally come exports, sorted by the export name.
Also, when there are multiple cells, their appearance in the file is sorted by the cell name.
The syntax is:
<P>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="90%">
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><B>C&lt;name&gt; | &lt;group&gt; | &lt;tech&gt; | &lt;creation&gt; | &lt;revision&gt; |
&lt;flags&gt; [ | &lt;variable&gt; ]*</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="20%">&lt;name&gt;</TD><TD WIDTH="80%">the name of the cell in the form "NAME;VERSION{VIEW}".</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;group&gt;</TD><TD>the name of this cell's group (if different than expected).
This field may be omitted in earlier-format libraries.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;tech&gt;</TD><TD>the technology of the cell.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;creation&gt;</TD><TD>the creation date of the cell (Java format).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;revision&gt;</TD><TD>the revision date of the cell (Java format).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;flags&gt;</TD><TD>flags for the cell.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;variable&gt;</TD><TD>a list of variables on the cell
(see <A HREF="chap10-04-01.html#chap10-04-01">Section 10-4-1</A>).</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Java format for dates (the creation and revision dates) is in milliseconds
since the "epoch" (Midnight on January 1, 1970, GMT).
<P>
The &lt;flags&gt; field consists of any of the following letters, (sorted alphabetically):
<P>
"C"	if this cell is part of a cell-library.<BR>
"E"	if the cell should be created "expanded".<BR>
"I"	if instances in the cell are locked.<BR>
"L"	if everything in the cell is locked.<BR>
"T"	if this cell is part of a technology-library.
<P>
Example:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE><FONT SIZE="-1">CrxArray;1{lay}||mocmos|1092185029000|1092185060000|I</FONT></CODE>
<BR>
Declares cell "rxArray{lay}", version 1, associated with the "mocmos" technology.
The cell was created at date 1092185029000 and last modified at date 1092185060000.
All instances in the cell are locked.
<P>
<!-- NEED 3in -->
<H4>Groups</H4>
<P>
In older JELIB files, the group information appears in special group lines.
Each group line consists simply of a list of cells in that group.
The first cell listed is the "main schematics" of the group.
If there is no such cell, the first field is empty.
After that, the cells appear in alphabetical order.
When multiple groups are declared, they appear sorted by the group name (which is derived from the cell names in it).
The syntax is:
<P>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="90%">
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><B>G&lt;cell&gt; | &lt;cell&gt; | ... | &lt;cell&gt;</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="12%">&lt;cell&gt;</TD><TD WIDTH="88%">the name of the cells in the group.
&lt;cell&gt; may consists only of proto name,
because all cells with the same base name are put into the same group.</TD></TR>
