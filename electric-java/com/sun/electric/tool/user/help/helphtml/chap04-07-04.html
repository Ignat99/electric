<P>
This mode can also be invoked with the
<B>Toggle Measure Distance</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Modes / Edit</B>) or the
<B>Toggle Measurement Mode</B> command (in menu <B>Window / Measurements</B>).
Another way to measure distances is to use the cursor coordinates, displayed in the status area.

Measurements remain on the screen until removed with the <B>Clear Measurements</B>
command (in menu <B>Window / Measurements</B>)

<H4>Measuring in an Edit Window</H4>
<P>
In measure mode, each click places a new point on the display, and shows the distance to the previous point.
Clicking the right button lets you start a new measure point without connecting it to the previous one.
If you hold the shift key down, the cursor snaps to points and edges.
Double-clicking the right button removes the measurements.
The measurement text is scaled by the global text scale
(see <A HREF="chap06-08-04.html#chap06-08-04">Section 6-8-4</A>).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
<P>
Measurements can be drawn in two different styles: Electric and Cadence.
Electric style shows the coordinates of the endpoints and shows the distance in the center.
Cadence style shows a notched ruler with distances along the way.
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig04-24.png" ALT="Figure 4.24"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
This is controlled with the "Cadence measurement style" preference
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "Display Control" tab).
<P>
The measured distance can be used by the <B>Array...</B> command (in menu <B>Edit</B>) to specify spacing
(see <A HREF="chap06-04.html#chap06-04">Section 6-4</A>).
<P>
<H4>Measuring in a Waveform Window</H4>
<P>
When waveform windows are measured, the display shows a rectangle,
with low and high time values as well as low and high waveform values.
Each new click drags-out a different measurement.
Use the right-click to clear all measurement displays in the panel.
