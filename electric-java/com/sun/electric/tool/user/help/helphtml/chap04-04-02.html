Besides scaling, you can also pan the window contents,
shifting it about on the display.
This is typically done with the sliders on the right and bottom of the window.
On systems that have a mouse wheel, you can use it to pan vertically
(and hold the shift key while rolling the mouse wheel to pan horizontally).
On systems with a middle mouse button, this button pans the display.

You can also use the Pan tool from the tool bar to move the window contents.
Once in this mode, clicking and dragging slides the circuitry smoothly.
This mode can also be invoked with the
<B>Toggle Pan</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Modes / Edit</B>).

<P>
Yet another way to control screen panning is to use menu commands.
The <B>Pan Left</B>, <B>Pan Right</B>, <B>Pan Up</B>,
and <B>Pan Down</B> commands (in menu <B>Window</B>) all shift the window contents appropriately
(and because they are bound to quick keys, these operations can even be done from the keyboard).
By default, these commands shift the screen by about 30% of its size.
You can use the Display Control Preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "Display Control" tab),
to change that amount.
The <B>Small</B> panning distance causes subsequent shifts to be about 15% of the screen size.
The <B>Medium</B> panning distance causes subsequent shifts to be about 30% of the screen size.
The <B>Large</B> panning distance causes subsequent shifts to be about 60% of the screen size.
<P>
There are five special panning commands in the <B>Window / Special Pan</B> menu:
<UL>
<LI><B>Center Selection</B> makes the window shift so that the highlighted objects are in the center of the window.</LI>
<LI><B>Center Cursor</B> makes the window shift so that the current cursor location is in the center of the window.
Note that this command is useful only when bound to a keystroke,
because you cannot issue the command and have a valid cursor location at the same time.</LI>
<LI><B>Match Other Window in X</B> redraws the current window so that it has the same horizontal pan as the other.
If there are more than two windows, you will be asked to select the window to match.</LI>
<LI><B>Match Other Window in Y</B> redraws the current window so that it has the same vertical pan as the other.
If there are more than two windows, you will be asked to select the window to match.</LI>
<LI><B>Match Other Window in X, Y and Scale</B> redraws the current window so that it has the same zoom and pan as the other.
If there are more than two windows, you will be asked to select the window to match.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
One final command is useful if the display appears incorrect.
If this happens, redraw the screen with the <B>Redisplay Window</B> command (in menu <B>Window</B>).
