<!-- HEADER 10-4-2: Text Descriptors -->

Text descriptors appear in every Variable, and also in other places (cell instances and exports).
All text descriptors have an anchor factor ("D0" through "D9").
If the anchor starts with a lower-case "d", the text is hidden (but the descriptor information is remembered).
Here are the fields of a text descriptor:
