For documentation purposes, it is possible to display a <I>directional</I> arrow on arcs to indicates flow.
This property can be changed with the <B>Toggle Directionality</B> command (in menu
 <B>Edit / Arc</B>).
It may also be controlled by the <B>Object Properties...</B> dialog (in menu <B>Edit / Properties</B>).

<P>
The controls in the <B>Object Properties...</B> dialog offer the option of placing the arrow head
on either end, both ends, or neither end.
This allows arbitrary combinations of arrow heads and bodies to display arbitrarily intricate directionality
schemes.
