<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>
When NCC finds mismatches, a window pops up displaying the mismatches.
Below is a typical display with some essential features.
</P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-42.png" ALT="Figure9.42"></CENTER>
<P>
The left side of the window is a tree providing an overview of the kinds
of mismatches that NCC found. The right side has information
corresponding to the currently selected tree node(s).</P>
<P>
Each top-level tree node corresponds to a comparison of two cells.
In the above example, the label on the top-level node indicates that the
comparison that failed was between the cells: 
"bitslice{sch}" and "bitslice{lay}" in the library: "mipscells".
If the two cells have different names or are from different libraries,
then their names are shown individually.
For example, "libraryA:gateA{sch} &amp; libraryB:gateB{sch}".
The number in square brackets at the right end of the cell names,
in this example "[34]", is the number of mismatches.</P>
<P>
In general, if you see a tree node with a number in square brackets,
then this number is the total number of mismatches grouped under this
node.</P>
<P>
Selecting a top-level tree node displays the number of parts, wires, and ports
in the compared cells in the right part of the window.
For all other nodes, the right side of the window displays a list of
component names arranged in different ways, as described in
subsequent sections. Some components are highlightable, in which case
their names are printed as blue, red, or green hyperlinks.</P>
<P>
A top-level node has one or more subnodes. Subnodes can have the
following types: Exports, Parts, Wires, Parts (hash code), Wires
(hash code), Sizes, Export Assertions, Export/Global Network
Conflicts, Export/Global Characteristics Conflicts, and Unrecognized
Parts.

Sun Microsystems Laboratories Technical Report 2006-152, January 2006.

<H4>Exports</H4>
<P>
The exports node is always a leaf node with the name "Exports
[X]", where "X" is
the number of export mismatches in this comparison.
Selecting an exports node displays a table on the right side of the
NCC graphical window (see below). The table has two columns -
one per compared cell. The header contains cell names. Each row
corresponds to a mismatch. A table cell has zero or more <I>export
lists</I>. An export list is a list of all the exports found on a
network and is displayed as a list of export names surrounded by
curly brackets "{ }". Each export
list is a single hyperlink which highlights all the exports in the
list.</P>
<P>
Multiple export lists in a table cell occur when a single network in one
design (e.g. the schematic) has one or more exports that match
multiple exports attached to more than one network in the other
design (e.g. the layout). For example, the mismatch on the third row
from the top in the figure below has layout exports (the second column)
attached to a single network matching schematic exports (the first
column) attached to two networks.</P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-43.png" ALT="Figure 9.43"></CENTER>
<P>
An empty table cell means one design has exports that match no exports
with the same names in the other design. For example, the mismatch in
the top row above has the layout export "E_core_sclk"
matching no exports in the schematic.</P>
<P>
Some exports are <I>implied</I>. For example, if a schematic cell uses a
global ground, but does not contain an export for that ground, then
NCC will automatically insert an implied
export for ground. This
is done because most often the corresponding layout cell has a ground
export, and we want the schematic and layout cells to match. Implied
exports are not hyperlinked and have ":
implied" added to their names (see below).</P>
<P>
When NCC does not find any topological mismatches, it attempts to suggest
possible matches for exports that failed to match by name. Such
<I>suggestions</I> are printed in green. The first row of the table
below indicates that the "outO[1][T]"
export in the layout topologically matches the "outO[T]"
export in the schematic, even though they have different names. The
second row indicates that the "outE[1][F]"
export in the layout topologically matches the "net@4[1]"
wire in the schematic, even though the "net@4[1]"
wire has no exports. Note that a wire name is not an export list and
is not surrounded by curly brackets.</P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-44.png" ALT="Figure 9.44"><BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Implied exports are marked by &quot;implied&quot;. Suggestions
are printed in green.</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
Exports that match by name, but are not on equivalent networks, have red
hyperlinks. Such exports might have suggested matches as well, 
which are printed in green. In the first row of the table below,
the "jtag[1]" export in the
schematic does not topologically match the "jtag[1]"
export in the layout, but does match the "jtag[8]"
export in the layout.</P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-45.png" ALT="Figure 9.45"><BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Exports that match by name, but are not on equivalent networks
have red hyperlinks</FONT></CENTER>

<H4>Parts and Wires</H4>
<P>
NCC finds mismatches by applying two partitioning techniques in sequence.
First it uses <I>local partitioning</I> and
then it uses <I>hash code partitioning</I>. If local partitioning
finds mismatches, then NCC reports only those. The mismatches in
local partitioning of parts and wires are grouped under nodes with
names "Parts [X]" and "Wires [X]",
where "X" is the number of mismatched local partitioning classes (see figure below).
Each class node represents a class of parts or wires sharing the same
local characteristics.</P>
<P>
<!-- NEED 3in -->
<H5>Parts</H5>
<P>
Parts are partitioned into equivalence
classes based upon their type and the number of wires attached to
them. The figure below shows a list of two part classes.</P>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="fig09-46.png" ALT="Figure 9.46"></CENTER>
<P>
The tree node corresponding to the
first class is selected and has the name
<BR>
<CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#3 [4]: mipscells:mux2</CODE>
<BR>
which has the following meaning:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE><U>#3</U></CODE> The sequence number of this class</LI>
<LI><CODE><U>[4]</U></CODE> The number of mismatched parts in one of the two cells, whichever is
bigger. In our example, the schematic cell has 4 mismatched part
in this class and the layout has 3 mismatched parts in this
class. The maximum of 4 and 3 is 4 and, therefore, the tree node
has "[4]" in its name.</LI>
<LI><CODE><U>mipscells</U></CODE> Part library</LI>
<LI><CODE><U>mux2</U></CODE> Part
 type</LI>
</UL>
<P>
In the example above, part types were
enough to partition parts into classes. In many other cases, like the
one in the figure below, types are not enough and the number of different
wires attached to a part is employed as an additional partitioning
criterion.</P>

<P>
When a part class node is
selected, the right half of the window displays a two-column table.
Each column corresponds to one of the compared cells and has a list
of that cell's parts which belong to the selected part class.
Matched parts are printed in green.</P>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="fig09-47.png" ALT="Figure 9.47"><BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">The number of attached Wires as a Part class characteristic</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
Parts on the same line match each other. Mismatched parts are printed in red in no
particular order.</P>
<P>
<H5>Wires</H5>
<P>
NCC partitions wires into equivalence
classes based upon the number of different port types attached to
them. Examples of port types include an NMOS "gate"
port, a PMOS "diffusion" port,
and a NAND "output" port.
Port type counts are represented as a list of leaf nodes under the wire
class node. Since zero-value counts at the beginning of the list tend
to be numerous and are rarely used by designers, they are further
grouped under a "0's"; node.</P>

<P>
For example, in the figure below, the second wire class is expanded and we can
see its four characteristics, the first three of which are &quot;zero&quot;.
The first characteristic has a leaf node called
"pads180nm_150um:PAD_raw welltapL ports", which means that wires in this class
are <I>not</I> attached to
the port "welltapL" of the part
"PAD_raw" from the library
"pads180nm_150um".</P>

<P>
The fourth characteristic is "1 = number of pads180nm_150um:PAD_raw padRaw ports".
The name suggests that all wires in this class are connected to the
"padRaw" ports of 3 instances of
parts with type "PAD_raw" from
library "pads180nm_150um".</P>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="fig09-41.png" ALT="Figure 9.41"></CENTER>
<P>
When a wire class node is selected, the
right half of the window displays a two-column table (see figure below). Each
column corresponds to one of the compared cells and has a list of
that cell's wires which belong to the selected wire class. Matched
wires are printed in green, the two wires on the same line match each
other. Mismatched wires are printed in red in no particular order.</P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-48.png" ALT="Figure 9.48"></CENTER>
<P>
The tree node names contain the first mismatched wires from both lists.
For example, in the above figure, the first wire class has the node name
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>#1 : {alucontrol[2],...} { }  [3]</CODE>
<BR>
which has the following meaning:</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE><U>#1</U></CODE> The sequence number of this class.</LI>
<LI><CODE><U>{alucontrol[2],...}</U></CODE> The first mismatched wire in the first cell's list is called "alucontrol[2]"
The ellipsis after the name suggest that there is more than one wire in the list.</LI>
<LI><CODE><U>{ }</U></CODE> The name of the mismatched wire in the second cell's list (nothing is found).</LI>
<LI><CODE><U>[3]</U></CODE> The number of mismatched wires in one of the two cells, whichever is
bigger. In our example, the schematic cell has 3 mismatched wires
in this class, and the layout has 0 mismatched wires in this
class. The maximum of 3 and 0 is 3, and therefore, the tree node
has "[3]" in its name.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H5>Hash Code Partitioning</H5>
<P>
If local partitioning fails to find a mismatch, then NCC reports
mismatches found by <I>hash code partitioning</I>
under the nodes labeled "Parts (hash code)" and "Wires (hash code)".
Unlike their local partitioning
counterparts, hash code partitioning classes do not have any
characteristics.</P>
<P>
<H5>Selecting Multiple Classes</H5>
<P>
It is possible to select more than one
class by holding the <I>Control</I> (<I>Command</I> on Macintosh) or
the <I>Shift</I> key during selection. In this case, the right side
will have multiple rows, one row per class. The figure below shows what is
displayed when the three wire classes in the figure above are selected. Up to
five classes can be displayed at once. Rows are arranged in the order
in which the classes are selected.</P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-49.png" ALT="Figure 9.49"><BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Up to five equivalence classes can be selected simultaneously</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
Selecting one or more subnodes of a
class node is equivalent to selecting the class node itself. This
means that no class appears twice in the table on the right. If some
node of a type different from Parts, Wires, Parts (hash code), or
Wires (hash code) is selected as well, then it has a higher display
priority and its contents are displayed instead. For example, if an
exports node was selected with the three wire class nodes, then the
export table would be displayed on the right.</P>
<P>

<H4>Sizes</H4>
<P>
Both length and width mismatches in
transistor and resistor sizes are collected under "Sizes [X]" node, where
"X" is the total number of size
mismatches. Resistor size mismatches are reported here, because
polysilicon resistors in both schematics and layout have lengths and
widths.</P>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="fig09-50.png" ALT="Figure 9.50"><BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">The size
mismatches table is sorted in the descending order of the relative
error</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
On the right side of the window,
mismatches are arranged into a table sorted in the descending order
of the relative error (see example above). Each mismatch occupies one row and
has four columns. The first column contains the relative error of the
mismatch. The second and third columns have widths and lengths of the
corresponding parts in two cells. The mismatched value is printed in
red. The last column has hyperlinked part names.</P>
<P>
If a transistor has both a length and a
width mismatch, then these mismatches are displayed in separate rows
(e.g. the first and the second rows above).</P>
<P>

<H4>Export Assertions</H4>
<P>
It is very common for a layout cell, <CODE>A</CODE>,
to have multiple ground wires that are connected by it's
parent cell, <CODE>B</CODE>. For example,
cell <CODE>A</CODE> may have a wire with the
export "gnd" and a different wire
with the export "gnd_1". When
cell <CODE>B</CODE> instantiates <CODE>A</CODE>,
cell <CODE>B</CODE> connects <CODE>A</CODE>'s
exports "gnd" and "gnd_1".
However, <CODE>A</CODE>'s schematic
typically has only one combined "gnd"
wire. When NCC compares <CODE>A</CODE>'s
schematic and layout, it finds that the ground wires mismatch. As a
solution, the designer adds the following NCC annotation into <CODE>A</CODE>'s
layout cell:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE><FONT SIZE="-1">exportsConnectedByParent gnd gnd_1</FONT></CODE></P>
<P>
This annotation constitutes a promise
that whenever <CODE>A</CODE> is
instantiated, its exports "gnd"
and "gnd_1" will be connected.
Then, when NCC compares A's schematic and layout, it assumes that the
promise has been kept and the comparison passes. However, when NCC
compares <CODE>B</CODE>'s schematic and
layout, it checks to see if the designer is keeping the promise. If
the promise is not kept, and no new promise to connect exports in the
next parent is given, then NCC reports an export assertion error in
the "Export Assertions" leaf node.</P>
<P>
When an "Export Assertions" node is selected, it displays a table with
two columns and one or more rows (see below). Each row corresponds to
a broken promise. The first column has cell names. The second column
lists exports that the designer promised would be connected, but
which remained disconnected. The exports are organized into two or
more export lists. Each export list is a comma-separated list of
exports enclosed in curly brackets "{ }".
Exports in the same list are connected. Exports in
different lists are disconnected. The designer promised that all
exports in all lists would be connected.</P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-51.png" ALT="Figure 9.51"></CENTER>
<p>
All exports are individually highlightable. For example, if the designer clicks on the "vdd_1" 
export then NCC will open up a window for cell "scan3{lay}" and highlight the net connected
to the export "vdd_1".</p>
<p>
Tip: If it the design includes multiple instances of cell "rectifier{lay}" then
the designer can find out which particular instance failed to keep the promise by typing control-U
which will pop up a level in the hierarchy.
</p>
<P>

<H4>Export/Global Network and Characteristics Conflicts</H4>
<P>
In an export/global network conflict, a
cell has both an export and a global signal with the same name, but
their networks are topologically different (see below). Both the
global network export and the cell export are highlightable.</P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-52.png" ALT="Figure 9.52"></CENTER>
<P>
In an export/global characteristics
conflict, one cell also has both an export and a global signal with
the same name, but their characteristics differ (see below). The cell
export can be highlighted by clicking on its characteristics.</P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-53.png" ALT="Figure 9.53"></CENTER>
<P>

<H4>Unrecognized Parts</H4>
<P>
This node has a list of parts
(transistors and resistors) with unrecognized types (see below).
Each part can be highlighted by clicking on its type.</P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-54.png" ALT="Figure 9.54"></CENTER>
<P>

<H4>Advanced Features</H4>
<P>
The total number of mismatched cell
comparisons is displayed in square brackets on the top of the tree.
Only comparisons that did not pass NCC tests are counted and
displayed. Each failed comparison corresponds to one top-level tree
node. By default, NCC halts after the first failed comparison and,
therefore, the tree contains just one failed comparison.
If the user configures the NCC Preferences to continue
even after finding mismatched cells, then NCC compares all cells and
displays all that mismatch. When multiple cells have mismatches, the
left pane will display more than one top-level node as shown below.</P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-55.png" ALT="Figure 9.55"></CENTER>
<P>
Right-clicking on a tree
node or a table cell pops up a menu with an option to copy the node
name or the cell text to the system clipboard (see below).</P>
