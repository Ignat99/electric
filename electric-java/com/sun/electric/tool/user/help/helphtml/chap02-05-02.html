<!-- HEADER 2-5-2: Arc Sizing -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Size/All Selected Arcs... -->

To change the width of an arc, issue the <B>Interactively</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Size</B>).
Note that the arc stretches about its center so that an edge is at the cursor location.
Click a button to make the change.
To change the size of more than one arc at a time, select the arcs and use the <B>All Selected Arcs...</B> command.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Another way to change an arc's width is to select it and use the <B>Object Properties...</B> command
(in menu <B>Edit / Properties</B>).
<P>
Note that when typing size amounts into a dialog, specify the size of the highlighted area.
A CMOS active arc shows highlighting only on its active area,
even though the complete arc has implant regions that are much larger.
<P>
The "Name" field lets you name an arc (see <A HREF="chap06-08-01.html#chap06-08-01">Section 6-8-1</A>).
Arc names are only displayed on the arc if they have been explicitly typed into this dialog.
You can also use the "Props." button to show a dialog that controls all aspects of a displayed arc name.
<P>
The "Easy to Select" checkbox enables selection of the arc with a simple click
(see <A HREF="chap02-01-05.html#chap02-01-05">Section 2-1-5</A>).

<P>

the "Color and Pattern..." button is available for setting its color.
