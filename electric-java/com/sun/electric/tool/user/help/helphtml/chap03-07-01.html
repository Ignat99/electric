To get some basic information about the current cell
(size, dates, etc) use the <B>Describe this Cell</B> command
(in menu <B>Cell / Cell Info</B>).
<P>
To get information about more than one cell, use the <B>General Cell Lists...</B> command.
The dialog selects a subset of the cells in the current library.
<P>
The section labeled "Which cells:" selects the cells to be listed
(all, only those used in other cells,
only those NOT used in the current cell,
only those in the current cell,
or only "placeholder" cells: those created because of cross-library dependency failures,
see <A HREF="chap03-09-01.html#chap03-09-01">Section 3-9-1</A>).
<P>
The section labeled "View filter:" allows only certain views to be displayed.
<P>
The section labeled "Version filter:" allows removal of older or newer versions of cells.
<P>
The section labeled "Display ordering:" controls the order in which the selected cells will be listed.
<P>
The section labeled "Destination:" allows you to dump this listing to a disk file,
formatted for spreadsheets (tab-separated).

<P>
The "Evaluate Numbers when Sorting Names" checkbox controls how cells are sorted
(only relevant when cells are to be ordered by name).
When checked, numbers inside of cell names are evaluated and sorted numerically.
Thus, a set of cells called "A8", "A9", "A10", and "A11" will appear in that order.
When not checked, cells are sorted lexically, causing the cells to appear in this order:
"A10", "A11", "A8", "A9".

The last five columns show the usage and four state bits.
The usage is the number of times that this cell appears as an instance in other cells.
The state bits are:
<UL>
<LI>"L" if the cell contents are locked</LI>
<LI>"I" if instances in the cell are locked</LI>
<LI>"S" if the cell is a standard cell</LI>
<LI>"D" if the cell has passed design-rule checking</LI>
</UL>
<P>
For more cell information, use the commands of menu <B>Cell / Cell Info</B>:
<UL>
<LI><B>Summarize Cell Contents</B> lists the nodes and layers used in the current cell.</LI>
<LI><B>Summarize Selected Cell Contents</B> lists the nodes and layers used in the selected geometry.</LI>
<LI><B>List Nodes/Arcs in this Cell</B> counts the number of nodes and arcs in current cell and below.
This is a hierarchical count: if two cell instances each have two transistors inside of them,
the total is 4 transistors.
However, it counts only actual nodes, ignoring arrayed nodes
(see <A HREF="chap06-09-03.html#chap06-09-03">Section 6-9-3</A>).</LI>
<LI><B>List Cell Instances</B> shows all cell instances below the current cell.</LI>
<LI><B>List Cell Usage</B> looks up the hierarchy and finds cells that contain the
current cell as an instance.</LI>
<LI><B>List Cell Usage, Hierarchically</B> looks up the hierarchy and finds cells that contain the
current cell as an instance or as a subinstance.
For example, if cell A contains cell B, and cell B contains cell C,
then using this command on cell C will mention both cells A and B,
whereas the nonhierarchical version of this command will mention only cell B.</LI>
<LI><B>Number of Transistors</B> counts the number of transistors in the current cell and below
(considering arrayed instances, see <A HREF="chap02-04-02.html#chap02-04-02">Section 2-4-2</A>).</LI>
</UL>
