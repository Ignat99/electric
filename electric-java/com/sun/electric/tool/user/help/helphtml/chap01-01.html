Now you have it!
<P>
A state-of-the-art computer-aided design system for VLSI circuit design.
<P>
Electric designs MOS and bipolar integrated circuits,
printed-circuit-boards, or any type of circuit you choose.
It has many editing styles including layout, schematics, artwork, and architectural specifications.
<P>
A large set of tools is available including design-rule checkers,
simulators, routers, layout generators, and more.
<P>
Electric interfaces to most popular CAD specifications including EDIF, LEF/DEF, VHDL, CIF and GDS.
<P>
The most valuable aspect of Electric is its layout-constraint system,
which enables top-down design by enforcing consistency of connections.
<P>
This manual explains the concepts and commands necessary to use Electric.
It begins with essential features and builds on them to explain all aspects of the system.
As with any computer system manual, the reader is encouraged to have a machine handy and to try out each operation.
