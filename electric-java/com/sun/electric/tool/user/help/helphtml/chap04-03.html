Initially, there is only one editing window on the screen.
Electric allows you to create multiple editing windows,
each of which can show a different cell.
You can also have the same cell in more than one window to see it at different scales and locations.
<P>
New windows are created by checking the appropriate checkbox in the <B>New Cell...</B> or <B>Edit Cell...</B>
commands (in menu <B>Cell</B>).
New windows can also be created from the cell explorer by using the context menu on a cell name.
<P>
All of the windows are listed at the bottom of the <B>Window</B> pulldown menu,
including the Messages Window.
To bring a window to the top for editing, select its name from this list.
To cycle through the different windows, type "q".
<P>
To delete a window, click its close box, or use the <B>Close Window</B> command (in menu <B>Window</B>).
Note that you cannot delete the last window on systems where the pulldown menu is inside of each window,
because then the pulldown menus would become unavailable.
<P>
When there are many editing windows on the display,
you can arrange them neatly with the <B>Window / Adjust Position</B> commands.
The <B>Tile Horizontally</B> command adjusts the windows so that they are full-width,
but just tall enough to fill the screen, one above the other.
The <B>Tile Vertically</B> command adjusts the windows so that they are full-height,
but just wide enough to fill the screen, one next to the other.
The <B>Cascade</B> command adjusts the windows so that they are all the same size and overlap each other uniformly from the upper-left to the lower-right.

<P>
<H4>Window Frames</H4>
<P>
When Electric runs on the Windows operating systems, each editing window lives inside of a larger frame on the display.
This is called an MDI (Multiple Document Interface) interaction.
On non-Windows systems (UNIX/Linux, Macintosh, etc.) each editing window is a separate frame on the display.
This is called an SDI (Single Document Interface) interaction.
Note that Windows users can request an SDI interaction, and non-Windows users can request MDI interaction.
This is done with command-line switches (see <A HREF="chap01-03.html#chap01-03">Section 1-3</A>).
<P>
When running in SDI mode, there are two extra commands (in menu <B>Windows</B>) for controlling the frames:
<UL>
<LI><B>Move to Other Display</B> requests that the current window frame be moved to a different display.
Some systems (Macintosh) let you drag the frames between displays, but others keep each display distinct, requiring
this command to make the move.</LI>
<LI><B>Remember Location of Display</B> requests that the current editing window's frame location be used as the
initial location when Electric runs again.
This command can also be used to start the system on a different display.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Display Considerations</H4>
<P>
Electric offers many settings for controlling the display, available in the Display Control Preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "Display Control" tab).
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig04-20.png" ALT="Figure 4.20"></CENTER>
<P>
The status area at the bottom of the screen shows current selection, cursor coordinates, etc.
If "Show hierarchical cursor coordinates in status bar" is checked,
it will also show global coordinates when traversing the hierarchy.
<P>
The side bar can be set to always show on the right by checking "Side Bar defaults to the right side".
See <A HREF="chap01-07.html#chap01-07">Section 1-7</A> for more on the side bar.
<P>
When editing "down-in-place", the upper levels of hierarchy are dimmed.
Some displays find this difficult to do and draw slowly in down-in-place mode.
This is particularly noticeable on X Window systems that use Xorg and Xinerama.
To disable the dimming and speed the display,
uncheck "Dim upper levels of hierarchy when editing Down-In-Place".
See <A HREF="chap03-05.html#chap03-05">Section 3-5</A> for more on down-in-place editing.
<P>
Many commands cause cells to be displayed in a new window.
If you uncheck "Show cell results in new window", then the cells are shown in the current window instead.
<P>
When errors are highlighted, the highlighting pulsates to make the error more visible.
To disable pulsating highlighting, uncheck "Make error highlighting pulsate".
<P>
Another error display control is "Shift window to show errors" which requests that the window pan and zoom
to focus on the error.
When this is not checked, errors that are off-screen cause an arrow to briefly display indicating the
direction of the error.
<P>
Many dialogs are "modeless" meaning that they can remain up while other work is done.
These modeless dialogs can be covered by the editing windows.
Checking "Keep modeless dialogs on top" forces these dialogs to always remain visible.
<P>
The Measurement tool is used to show distances (see <A HREF="chap04-07-04.html#chap04-07-04">Section 4-7-4</A>).
Checking "Cadence measurement style" requests that it draw rulers similar to Cadence systems.
<P>
The "Dock messages window to each edit window" requests that the messages window be
attached to the edit window, instead being a separate window.
<P>
When panning the window using menu commands, the distance to pan can be controlled with the
"Panning distance" selection (see <A HREF="chap04-04-02.html#chap04-04-02">Section 4-4-2</A> for more on panning).
<P>
The "Display style" controls whether Electric uses the MDI (Multiple Document Interface) or the SDI
(Single Document Interface) style of interaction.
MDI (used typically on Windows systems) uses a single large window that has all of the editing windows
inside of it.
SDI (used typically on Linux and Macintosh systems) creates a window for every editing window in Electric.
You can leave the default style for your operating system, or you can override that and force a style.

<H4>Display Algorithms</H4>
<P>
Electric has three different display algorithms:
<UL>
<LI>The "Pixel Display Algorithm" is the older.
It was the only display algorithm prior to version 8.04 of Electric.</LI>
<LI>The "Vector Display Algorithm" is newer, and is faster for panning and zooming.
This algorithm optimizes the display of circuitry by simplifying the display of objects when they get to be very small.
For example, when zoomed-out very far, a transistor may be only 1 screen pixel in size, and it does not make sense to carefully
compute and draw all of its parts.
In such cases, the algorithm "simplifies" display of the object, usually drawing it as a single dot.
<P>
Besides simplifying individual nodes and arcs, Electric also simplifies the display of entire cells
if their contents are all too small to draw.
Such simplification can consist of rendering the cell with a single "approximating" color,
or keeping a small image of the cell and using it in the proper place.
<P>
There are some controls for the Vector Display Algorithm.
The first control selects whether cell simplification uses an image of the cell or just an approximating color.
The next control determines the size at which objects are simplified.
The default is to "Simplify objects smaller than 3 pixels".
Making this value smaller will cause more detailed drawing, but take longer.
The last control determines the threshold for simplifying entire cells.
Although a cell's contents may be small, the cell may be quite large on the screen, and so should not be simplified
(this happens to top-level cells in a deep hierarchy).
The default limit is to "Do not simplify cells greater than 10 percent of the screen".
Making this number smaller causes more cells to be drawn fully.
Making this number zero turns off cell simplification.</LI>
<LI>The "Layer Display Algorithm" is the newest, but still experimental.
It has controls for the use of pattern displays, and has controls for Alpha blending (used in layer composition).
When zoomed out below the "Alpha blending overcolor limit", standard alpha blending composition rule is used.
When zoomed in above this limit, alphablending with overcolor composition rule is used.</LI>
