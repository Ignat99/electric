<!-- HEADER 8-1: Technology Editing -->

Although there are many technology descriptions in Electric,
there are many more in the world.
To accommodate this,
there are three ways to define a technology in Electric:
<UL>
<LI>The <I>Technology Editor</I> allows you to modify existing technologies and create new ones.
The technology editor is describe here and in
<A HREF="chap08-02.html#chap08-02">Sections 8-2</A> through
<A HREF="chap08-09.html#chap08-09">8-9</A>.</LI>
<LI>The <I>Technology Creation Wizard</I> constructs technologies from simple process parameters.
The technology creation wizard is described in <A HREF="chap08-11.html#chap08-11">Section 8-11</A>.</LI>
<LI>The <I>Technology XML Files</I> define technologies and can be created or hand-edited.
The file format is described in <A HREF="chap08-10.html#chap08-10">Section 8-10</A>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The technology editor works by converting a technology into a library of cells.
You then edit the cells, using familiar Electric commands, and make changes to the technology.
Finally, the technology editor translates the library back into a new technology.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
Libraries which describe a technology are called <I>technology libraries</I>.
They use elements from the Artwork technology to describe their information.
Special commands from the <B>Edit / Technology Editing</B> menu aid in the manipulation of these libraries.
<P>
There are four types of cells in a technology library which describe the <I>layers</I>,
<I>arcs</I>, <I>nodes</I>, and <I>support</I>.
They are separated into these groups in the cell explorer.
The layer cells all begin with the name "layer-" and each one defines a layer in the technology.
For example, the cell called "layer-Metal" defines the metal layer.
The node and arc cells correspond to the primitives in the technology.
Their names always begin with "node-" and "arc-".
The support cell is always called "factors".
Any other cell in the library is ignored.
