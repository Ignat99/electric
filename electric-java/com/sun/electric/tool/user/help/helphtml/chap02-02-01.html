<!-- HEADER 2-2-1: Node Creation -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Text/Add Text Annotation -->

Node creation is done by selecting a node from the component menu in the side bar (on the left).
Nodes in the component menu are outlined in blue.
After clicking on one of these nodes, click in the edit window to place the node.
If you hold the Control key, the node location will snap to one of the axes.
<P>
The location of the cursor is aligned to the nearest grid unit.
This adjustment can be controlled with the
Grid Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "Grid" tab,
see <A HREF="chap04-07-02.html#chap04-07-02">Section 4-7-2</A>).
<P>
When placing a node, the cursor points to the <I>anchor point</I> of the newly created node.
This is the center (for primitives) or the location of the cell-center (for cell instances).
Cell instances can change their anchor point by moving the Cell-Center node inside of their layout
(see <A HREF="chap03-03.html#chap03-03">Section 3-3</A>).
<P>
When placing a node, but before you click to actually create the node, it is possible to temporarily
switch from node-placement to zoom/pan mode.
This allows you to better select the location of the newly-created node.
To temporarily zoom, type "z", zoom the display, and then type "z" again to finish placing the node.
To temporarily pan, type "p", pan the display, and then type "p" again to finish placing the node.
For more on zooming and panning, see <A HREF="chap04-04-01.html#chap04-04-01">Sections 4-4-1</A> and
<A HREF="chap04-04-02.html#chap04-04-02">Sections 4-4-2</A>.
<P>
Besides basic components, there are special entries in the component menu for creation of additional nodes:
<UL>
<LI>The "Cell" button displays a list of cell instances that can be created
(see <A HREF="chap03-03.html#chap03-03">Section 3-3</A>).</LI>
<LI>The "Pure" button (only available in layout technologies) lets you place pure-layer nodes
(see <A HREF="chap06-10-01.html#chap06-10-01">Section 6-10-1</A>).</LI>
<LI>The "Spice" button (only available in schematics) lets you place Spice primitives
(see <A HREF="chap09-04-03.html#chap09-04-03">Section 9-4-3</A>).</LI>
<!-- NEED 5in -->
<LI>The "Misc" button has a collection of special objects that can be created.</LI>
